### 🛡️ Windows Command Line

**Room:** [Windows Command Line — TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowscommandline)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** *14 May 2025*  

### 🎯 Objective
This room introduced the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe), focusing on its advantages over GUI interfaces and practical commands for system administration. The goal was to develop proficiency in using CLI for basic system diagnostics, network troubleshooting, file management, and process control.

### 🗝️ Key Concepts  
- **CLI Efficiency** — Command-line interfaces offer faster operation and lower resource usage compared to GUIs.  
- **System Diagnostics** — Commands like `systeminfo` and `ver` provide comprehensive OS and hardware details.  
- **Network Troubleshooting** — Tools including `ipconfig`, `ping`, `tracert`, and `netstat` help diagnose connectivity issues.  
- **File Management** — Commands such as `dir`, `copy`, `move`, and `del` enable efficient filesystem navigation and manipulation.  
- **Process Control** — `tasklist` and `taskkill` allow viewing and terminating running processes.  
- **Help System** — The `/?` parameter provides built-in documentation for any command.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Command Prompt (cmd.exe)** — Primary interface for executing all commands  
- **Network Utilities** — `ipconfig`, `ping`, `tracert`, `nslookup`, `netstat`  
- **File Management** — `dir`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `copy`, `move`, `del`  
- **Process Management** — `tasklist`, `taskkill`  
- **Output Control** — `more` for paginated output

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Initially struggled with remembering command syntax and parameters
- Found network troubleshooting commands particularly complex
- Overcame difficulties by:
  - Practising commands repeatedly in the lab environment
  - Using `/?` help parameter extensively

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to quickly retrieve system information without GUI tools
- Network diagnostic techniques using command-line utilities
- Efficient file management through CLI commands
- The importance of CLI skills for remote system administration
- How process management translates between Task Manager and command-line
- The resource efficiency advantages of CLI over GUI interfaces

---

### 🌐 Real-World Application:
> Command-line proficiency is essential for IT professionals managing Windows environments. These skills enable efficient remote administration through SSH, scripting of repetitive tasks, and troubleshooting systems with minimal resource overhead. The networking commands are particularly valuable for diagnosing connectivity issues in enterprise environments.
